# Contributor License Agreement (CLA), RACS

By submitting a contribution (a pull request, patch, or any other form of material) to the `@takk/racs` repository, You, the contributor, agree to the terms below. RACS (Remote Agent Context Store) is published under the Apache License 2.0; this agreement governs the contributor side.

Two paths are accepted; pick one by following the workflow in section 3.

---

## 1. The DCO path (default, preferred for most contributions)

Every commit in your pull request must end with a `Signed-off-by` trailer:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Add it automatically by passing `-s` to `git commit`. The signature asserts the **Developer Certificate of Origin v1.1** ([developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)):

> By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:
>
> (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have
>     the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in
>     the file; or
>
> (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of
>     my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license
>     and I have the right under that license to submit that work with
>     modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under
>     the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit
>     under a different license), as indicated in the file; or
>
> (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person
>     who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.
>
> (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are
>     public and that a record of the contribution (including all
>     personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
>     maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
>     this project and the open source license(s) involved.

The DCO is sufficient for individual contributions, small bug fixes, documentation improvements, and tests.

## 2. The signed-CLA path (required for substantive features)

If your contribution adds a new public surface, changes a core invariant (the no-provider-network-calls rule, the deterministic identity rules, the `CacheDirective` family semantics, the lint code meanings, the `StateBackend` or `KvLike` interfaces, or the `StateSnapshot` schema), or proposes a runtime dependency (which the project's zero-dependency policy will almost certainly reject), you additionally agree to the following:

1. **License grant.** You grant David C Cavalcante (the "Project Owner") and recipients of software distributed by the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contribution and such derivative works under the **Apache License, Version 2.0** (the project's code license).

2. **Patent grant.** You grant the Project Owner and recipients a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution alone or by combination of Your Contribution with the Project. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Project or a Contribution incorporated within the Project constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this CLA for that Contribution shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

3. **Original work.** You represent that the Contribution is Your original work, or You have all necessary rights to make the Contribution and the grants above. If Your employer has rights to intellectual property You create, You represent that You have received permission to make the Contribution on behalf of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights for the Contribution.

4. **No support obligation.** You are not expected to provide support for Your Contribution, except as You may decide on a voluntary basis.

To agree to this path, sign off your commits per section 1 **and** open the pull request with the title prefix `[CLA-signed]`. The Project Owner will respond with the canonical sign-off block to be appended to the PR description before merge.

---

## 3. Workflow

1. Fork the repository at [`github.com/davccavalcante/racs`](https://github.com/davccavalcante/racs).
2. Make your changes in a feature branch.
3. Run `pnpm install && pnpm verify` locally; lint, typecheck, tests, and build must all stay green (baseline: 187 tests across 13 suites).
4. Sign off each commit (`git commit -s`).
5. If your contribution falls under section 2, also prefix the PR title with `[CLA-signed]` and re-paste the relevant section 2 paragraphs in the PR body as evidence of consent.
6. Open the pull request against `main`.

---

## 4. Notes

- This document does NOT supersede the Apache 2.0 license; it adds the contributor-side agreement that lets the Project Owner re-license, sub-license, or dual-license the code base in the future without re-asking every contributor.
- Contributions that do not include a valid DCO sign-off (and the section 2 block where required) will be requested to amend before review.
- Open questions about the CLA itself: open a discussion or email **davcavalcante@proton.me** (or **say@takk.ag**) with subject `[CLA]`.
